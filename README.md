# PickUp Lines Generator
This project is made using a pickup_lines free api, just to get familiar with api calls and error handling in JavaScript.
The project handles error on it's own such that there won't come any error while fetching api. If network
issue appers, the pre-defined message will be shown for users so that they could know the reason for page not working out.
